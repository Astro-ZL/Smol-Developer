1. PyTorch: All files will share the PyTorch library as a dependency, as it is the main framework used for deep learning in this project.

2. DataLoader: "src/data_loader.py" will define a DataLoader class to handle the loading and preprocessing of the PTA gravitational wave data. This class will be used in "src/train.py" and "src/main.py".

3. Model: "src/model.py" will define the deep learning model structure. This model will be used in "src/train.py" and "src/main.py".

4. Training Function: "src/train.py" will define a function for training the model. This function will be used in "src/main.py".

5. Utility Functions: "src/utils.py" will define various utility functions that could be used across all other files.

6. Configurations: "src/config.py" will define various configurations such as hyperparameters, file paths, etc. These configurations will be used across all other files.

7. Main Function: "src/main.py" will use all the above components to run the entire pipeline of loading data, training the model, and finding gravitational wave signals.

8. Numpy and Pandas: These libraries will be used for data manipulation and analysis, and will be shared across "src/data_loader.py", "src/train.py", and "src/main.py".

9. Matplotlib and Seaborn: These libraries will be used for data visualization and will be shared across "src/data_loader.py", "src/train.py", and "src/main.py".

10. Scikit-learn: This library will be used for any additional machine learning tasks and will be shared across "src/data_loader.py", "src/train.py", and "src/main.py".

11. Python Standard Libraries: Libraries such as os, sys, and time will be used across all files for various tasks like file handling, system operations, and time calculations.
